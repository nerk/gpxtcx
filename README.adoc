= Gpx/Tcx Merge

This is a little utility to merge the output of a Garmin heart rate monitor (+.tcx+ file)
with a file generated by a GPS logger (Wintec? +.gpx+ file). The merged file is an enhanced
GPX file with additional heart rate information added as `TrackPointExtension` for each track point.

I wrote this program for a friend who was carrying two separate devices during
his training and wanted to combine the data into a single GPX file.

It works well for him and for the devices he is using, but I do not know
if there is a general purpose for this program. I wrote this several
years ago and do not really have a huge interest in it.
However, instead of having it just lying around on my local disk, it
now found a new home on Github.
